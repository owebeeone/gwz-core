//! Temporary directories that two tests never share.
//!
//! A name drawn from the process id and the clock is not unique: macOS reads
//! the clock to the microsecond, so tests that start together draw one name,
//! and a create that accepts an existing directory then hands each of them
//! the same one. Here `create_dir` refuses a name that exists, so a directory
//! returned is one this call created, and a taken name is retried with a
//! suffix. The clock only spreads the names out; no counter or other state is
//! kept between calls. A name that is free gets no suffix, so it is no longer
//! than the names fixtures drew before, which matters under Windows' MAX_PATH.
//!
//! This file names nothing outside std and holds no tests, so an integration
//! test can include it by `#[path]`.
